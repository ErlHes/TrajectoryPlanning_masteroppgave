\section{Introduction}
Placeholder text. this is a placeholder citation to remove an error: \cite{breivik2017mpc}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item something something this thesis is about trajcetory planning
    \item had this idea I wanted to try out
    \item This chapter explains my motivation for the thesis. discusses previous work of the same subject.
    Explains the problem as I see it, and my contributions to a solution. lastly an outline of the rest of the thesis for a quick intro of every section.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on the same subject matter for a "fordypningsprosjekt" (finn godt ord).
    \item Autonomous vehicle control is an important milestone on the journey to a fully autonomous life.
    \item It's also just fricking cool on a conceptual level.
    \item Fishing industries and other marine industries are 'behind the curve' and not given as much attention as land based industries.
    \item A great learning opportunity for practical implementations of theory learned over the past two years.
    \item All in all a highly relevant project for the career trajectory I want.
    \item AI is pretty cool too I guess
    \item wanted to see if there could be a difference if autonomous vessels had more advanced prediction algorithms.
    \item just make something up.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Previous Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item boy I sure wish I had read more resarch.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many papers on trajectory planning emjoy simple "cpa" prediction.
    \item Many algorithms end up creating a very 'active' vessel, which is different from how most humans navigate.
    \item \gls{COLREGs} compliance needs more attention.
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyse av fordeler med å ha bedre / avansert prediksjon av TS.
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Samma stil som på fordypningsoppgaven.
\end{itemize}
