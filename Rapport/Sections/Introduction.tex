\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item something something this thesis is about trajcetory planning
    \item had this idea I wanted to try out
    \item This chapter explains my motivation for the thesis. discusses previous work of the same subject.
    Explains the problem as I see it, and my contributions to a solution. lastly an outline of the rest of the thesis for a quick intro of every section.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on the same subject matter for a "fordypningsprosjekt" (finn godt ord).
    \item Autonomous vehicle control is an important milestone on the journey to a fully autonomous life.
    \item It's also just fricking cool on a conceptual level.
    \item Fishing industries and other marine industries are 'behind the curve' and not given as much attention as land based industries.
    \item A great learning opportunity for practical implementations of theory learned over the past two years.
    \item All in all a highly relevant project for the career trajectory I want.
    \item AI is pretty cool too I guess
    \item wanted to see if there could be a difference if autonomous vessels had more advanced prediction algorithms.
    \item just make something up.
    \item Find picture of some autonomous vessel or ferry
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Previous Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item cite \cite{loe2007collision} For in-depth look at many different methods.
    \item cite \cite{vagale2021path} For a review of path planning algorithms.
    \item cite \cite{zhang2021collision} For another big review on navigation systems for ASV
    \item cite \cite{huang2020ship} For another review of Collision avoidance.
    \item cite \cite{park2020social} For an alternative approach to Trajectory planning with similar-ish results.
    \item Cite someone to prove that Autonomous surface vessels are real? :thinking\_emoji:
    \item item I *need* to use \gls{COLREGs} at least once so that the formating looks nice later.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Description}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many papers on trajectory planning emjoy simple "cpa" prediction.
    \item Many algorithms end up creating a very 'active' vessel, which is different from how most humans navigate.
    \item Trajectory planning and collision avoidance in one package
    \item Would it help if we had the tools to more accurately predict other vessels.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel MPC based path following trajectory planner that accounts for both static and dynamic obstacles.
    \item An evaluation of the fitness of numerical optimization as trajectory planning backbone.
    \item documented simulations experimenting with the difference 'Prediction Level' makes.
    \item documented problems that numerical optimization based trajectory planner algorithms might encounter.
    \item propose mitigation methods for aformentioned problems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 2 is background theory.
    \item Chapter 3 is algorithm development.
    \item Chapter 4 is simulation results.
    \item Chapter 5 is conclusion and future work.
\end{itemize}
